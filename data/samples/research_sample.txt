## TITLE: Climate-Resilient Crop Varieties for Food Security

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This 18-month research project aims to identify and develop drought-resistant crop varieties that can maintain productivity under increasingly variable climate conditions. By screening 50 traditional and modern maize varieties for drought tolerance genes and validating their performance in field trials across three climate zones, we will develop practical recommendations for farmers facing water scarcity. The research combines advanced genomic analysis with participatory field testing to ensure both scientific rigor and practical applicability.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Climate change is significantly disrupting agricultural systems worldwide, with drought events increasing in both frequency and severity. Current crop varieties, optimized for stable climate conditions, show yield reductions of 20-40% under water stress. In the target region, over 60% of smallholder farmers have experienced crop failures in two of the past five growing seasons, threatening both livelihoods and regional food security.

## METHODOLOGY

Our research employs a three-phase approach:

1. **Genetic Screening**: We will analyze 50 maize varieties using targeted gene sequencing to identify drought-tolerance markers.

2. **Controlled Environment Testing**: The 15 most promising varieties will undergo controlled drought stress trials in greenhouse conditions.

3. **Participatory Field Validation**: The top 8 varieties will be planted in field trials across three agro-ecological zones, involving 60 smallholder farmers in the evaluation process.

## EXPECTED OUTCOMES

This research will deliver:

1. Identification of at least 3 drought-resistant maize varieties suitable for immediate adoption in the target region, with projected yield advantages of 25-35% under water stress conditions.

2. A validated screening protocol for drought tolerance that can be applied to other staple crops in future research.

3. Comprehensive dataset linking specific genetic markers to field performance across different environmental conditions.

4. Practical recommendations for farmers and extension services on variety selection and management practices to maximize resilience to drought events.

5. At least two peer-reviewed publications and an open-access farmer guidebook documenting findings and recommendations.
