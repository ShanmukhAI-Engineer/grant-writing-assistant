# Hybrid Approach Implementation Summary

## Overview
The **Hybrid Grant-Writing Approach** combines two complementary techniques:

1. **Few-Shot Prompting** – injects carefully curated, high-quality grant excerpts directly into the LLM prompts
2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** – stores a vector-indexed corpus of full-length sample grants

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Core grant generation system working (5-agent CrewAI workflow)
- ✅ Template-based proposal structure (5 grant types)
- ✅ RAG integration with user-uploaded PDFs
- ✅ Error handling and graceful fallbacks
- ⏳ Hybrid approach features in development

## Files Created/Modified
- enhanced_grant_app_working.py - Main Streamlit application with enhanced UI
- crew_agents/crew_builder.py - Enhanced with hybrid approach and error handling
- utils/rag_utils.py - Extended RAG functionality for sample grants
- 	emplates/ - Directory for few-shot examples (in development)
- data/samples/ - Directory for sample grant repository
- equirements_enhanced.txt - Updated dependencies

## Current Functionality
- Professional grant proposal generation using AI agents
- Template selection (Research, Non-Profit, Educational, Technology, Healthcare, Custom)
- PDF upload for additional context
- Word/PDF export with metadata
- Multiple AI model support (OpenAI, Groq)
- Progress tracking and error handling

## Next Steps
1. Complete few-shot examples library
2. Expand sample grant repository
3. Implement full hybrid RAG system
4. Add analytics dashboard
5. Create wizard mode for guided proposal creation
